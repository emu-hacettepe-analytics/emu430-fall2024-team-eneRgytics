# General Information About Data

This project includes detailed information on household electricity consumption in all 81 provinces to analyse energy consumption trends in Turkey, focusing on the effects of the permanent of daylight saving time in 2016, providing valuable insights on regional differences and usage patterns. This dataset covers the periods before and after the permanent of daylight saving time, enabling a comprehensive analysis of its impact on overall energy consumption. By analysing this dataset, the project aims to uncover meaningful trends and implications for energy efficiency, cost management and policy decisions.

# Why We Selected This Data

These datasets were selected on the basis of their relevance and comprehensiveness to answer the research question **???The impact of the permanent of summer time on energy consumption in Turkey???**. Household electricity consumption data from 81 provinces provide a detailed perspective on how individual households have adapted to the policy change. Overall, this dataset provides an important opportunity to analyse energy consumption data before and after 2016 together in order to better assess the impact of daylight saving time (DST) in Turkey.

# Our Objective

Our objective is to analyze the impact of permanent daylight saving time (DST) on energy consumption patterns in Turkey. By analyzing household electricity consumption in 81 provinces, we aim to identify key trends, evaluate the effectiveness of the policy, and provide foresight for future energy management strategies.

# Data Preprocessing

First we loaded our data and then looked at the number of NAs. There are no NAs in our data. There were Turkish characters in our data, and we convert Turkish characters to English characters so that the code works correctly, and we displayed the first sixteen lines of the dataset on your web page for ease of checking the operations performed.

### Loaded Our Data
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"
load("veri.RData")
library(knitr)
kable(head(veri, 16))
```


### Number of NAs
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"
total_of_numbers_NA <- sum(is.na(veri))
print(paste0("Number of NAs = ", total_of_numbers_NA))
```



### Summary of Data
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"
kable(summary(veri))
```


### Turkish to English Character Translation
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show code"
library(stringi)
veri$City <- lapply(veri$City, function(x) {
  ifelse (is.character(x), stri_trans_general(x, "Latin-ASCII"), x
)})
kable(head(veri, 16))
```
