# General Information About Data

This project utilizes two datasets to analyze the energy consumption trends in Turkey, focusing on the effects of the daylight saving time (DST) policy removal in 2016. The first dataset contains detailed information on residential electricity consumption across all 81 provinces, providing valuable insights into regional variations and usage patterns. The second dataset focuses on the electricity consumption of street lighting, an important factor in understanding public energy usage. Together, these datasets cover periods before and after the abolition of DST, enabling a comprehensive analysis of its impact on overall energy consumption. By examining these datasets, the project aims to uncover meaningful trends and implications for energy efficiency, cost management, and policy decisions.

# Why We Selected This Data

The selection of these datasets was driven by their relevance and comprehensiveness in addressing the research question: the impact of abolishing daylight saving time (DST) on energy consumption in Turkey. The residential electricity consumption data from 81 provinces provides a detailed perspective on how individual households adapted to the policy change, while the street lighting data captures a critical component of public electricity usage, particularly during evening hours. Together, these datasets enable a holistic analysis of energy consumption patterns before and after 2016, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the policy's effectiveness and its broader implications on energy efficiency and sustainability.

# Our Objective

Our objective is to analyze the impact of abolishing daylight saving time (DST) in Turkey on energy consumption patterns. By examining residential electricity usage across 81 provinces and street lighting data, we aim to identify significant trends, evaluate the policy's effectiveness, and provide insights for future energy management strategies.

# Data Preprocessing

First we upload the data set

Second, we convert Turkish characters to English characters so that the code works correctly
