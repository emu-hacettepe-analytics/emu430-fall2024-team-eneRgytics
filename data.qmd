# General Information About Data

This project includes detailed information on residential electricity consumption in all 81 provinces to analyse energy consumption trends in Turkey, focusing on the effects of the abolition of daylight saving time in 2016, providing valuable insights on regional differences and usage patterns. This dataset covers the periods before and after the abolition of daylight saving time, enabling a comprehensive analysis of its impact on overall energy consumption. By analysing this dataset, the project aims to uncover meaningful trends and implications for energy efficiency, cost management and policy decisions.

# Why We Selected This Data

The selection of these datasets was driven by their relevance and comprehensiveness in addressing the research question: the impact of abolishing daylight saving time (DST) on energy consumption in Turkey. The residential electricity consumption data from 81 provinces provides a detailed perspective on how individual households adapted to the policy change, while the street lighting data captures a critical component of public electricity usage, particularly during evening hours. Together, these datasets enable a holistic analysis of energy consumption patterns before and after 2016, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the policy's effectiveness and its broader implications on energy efficiency and sustainability.

# Our Objective

Our objective is to analyze the impact of abolishing daylight saving time (DST) in Turkey on energy consumption patterns. By examining residential electricity usage across 81 provinces and street lighting data, we aim to identify significant trends, evaluate the policy's effectiveness, and provide insights for future energy management strategies.

# Data Preprocessing

First we loaded our data and then looked at the number of NAs. There are no NAs in our data. There were Turkish characters in our data, and we convert Turkish characters to English characters so that the code works correctly, and we displayed the first sixteen lines of the dataset on your web page for ease of checking the operations performed.
