This is our project webpage.\nPlease stay tuned to follow our project activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Member\n\nAhmet Özcan\nEda Yılmaz\nSemih Güneş\n\n\n\nProject Topic\n\nThis project examines the impact of the removal of daylight saving time (DST) on electricity consumption in Turkey after 2016.\nTurkey is located between the 26° and 45° eastern meridians. Since there are 19 meridians between Turkey’s easternmost and westernmost points, the time difference between these points is 1 hour and 16 minutes. Therefore, before 2016, Turkey used the GMT+2 time zone (30° longitude) for 5 months of the year and switched to the GMT+3 time zone (45° longitude) as daylight saving time for the remaining 7 months.\nAfter 2016, Turkey has been using the GMT+3 time zone throughout the year.\nTo observe changes in electricity consumption, we use a dataset provided by the Turkish Statistical Institute. This dataset shows the amount of electricity consumed by households in each province in kilowatts (kW) until 2021. Based on this data, we conduct an analysis to examine the effect of removing DST on electricity consumption at the provincial level.\n\n\nProject Teaser\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Data Sources\n\n\n\nHousehold Electricity Consumption\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Information About Data\nThis project utilizes two datasets to analyze the energy consumption trends in Turkey, focusing on the effects of the daylight saving time (DST) policy removal in 2016. The first dataset contains detailed information on residential electricity consumption across all 81 provinces, providing valuable insights into regional variations and usage patterns. The second dataset focuses on the electricity consumption of street lighting, an important factor in understanding public energy usage. Together, these datasets cover periods before and after the abolition of DST, enabling a comprehensive analysis of its impact on overall energy consumption. By examining these datasets, the project aims to uncover meaningful trends and implications for energy efficiency, cost management, and policy decisions.\n\n\nWhy We Selected This Data\nThe selection of these datasets was driven by their relevance and comprehensiveness in addressing the research question: the impact of abolishing daylight saving time (DST) on energy consumption in Turkey. The residential electricity consumption data from 81 provinces provides a detailed perspective on how individual households adapted to the policy change, while the street lighting data captures a critical component of public electricity usage, particularly during evening hours. Together, these datasets enable a holistic analysis of energy consumption patterns before and after 2016, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the policy’s effectiveness and its broader implications on energy efficiency and sustainability.\n\n\nOur Objective\nOur objective is to analyze the impact of abolishing daylight saving time (DST) in Turkey on energy consumption patterns. By examining residential electricity usage across 81 provinces and street lighting data, we aim to identify significant trends, evaluate the policy’s effectiveness, and provide insights for future energy management strategies.\n\n\nOur Data Sets\n\n\n\nClick here to download .Rdata\n\n\n\n\nData Preprocessing\nFirst we upload the data set\nSecond, we convert Turkish characters to English characters so that the code works correctly\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
